About Me Avirion:
Been Gaming since the days of pong and Joust. I think the only console I did not own was the gamecube and the Dreamcast. 
I am really picky about the games I play. I look for the games overall feel, design, replayability, value, and immersaveness.
I really do not like paying full price for a game and the game only being able to played through one time or loosing interset.
While PC is the better way to play a game I prefer to play on consoles. I can spend 1500 dollars on 3 consoles and get access to about 90% of the games and do not need to worry about upgrading every 2 or 3 years. 
Favorite books are: He Who Fights with Monsters, Dungeon Crawler Carl, Lord of the Rings, It, and the Dune Series
Favorite Movies are: Dune (both the 1980's and the 2021 movie), Lord or the rings, Superman the one with Christopher Reeves, The Shawshank redemption, Flash Gordon, Space Balls.
Favorite TV shows are: The Flash, The lincon lawyer, Futerama, Rick and Morty. There are more but they are to nerdy or neiche to mention.
Favorite Games: Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10, Rocket League, Elder Scrolls 3 4 and 5 (look up the names if you are not sure), Legend of Zelda most all main enteries Twilight Pricess was and Skyward sword are my least liked.
I am engaged to get married next year. No I will not tell you her name. She likes to stay off Cammera.

High Chat Activity Protocol:
When chat activity is bustling, remain a silent observer. Only step in if directly addressed or mentioned.
